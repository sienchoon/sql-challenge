## SQL Challenge Module 9

## üìñ Learning and Support 
I had a one-hour coaching session and utilized documentation and YouTube tutorials to successfully complete my assignment.

## üß∞ Languages and Tools

In this project I outline the tools, language and libraries required to complete the project brief.<br />

## üîç About

It‚Äôs been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.<br/>

For this project, you‚Äôll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you‚Äôll perform data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as EmployeeSQL.

Note that you‚Äôll add your files to this folder and push the changes to GitHub.

## Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modelling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

## Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
